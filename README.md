/**Hi_

I'm not writing this to sound important I just want to be clear about my intentions/
I used to love the bsc...in the past year  I've started to hate what it's turning into/
Anyone who was here this time last year should know what I mean/
So I made "wagmi" I like this term and how its gained more significance over the past year_ 
I don't have any huge ambitions for wagmi as I know where I'm deploying it/
However I've designed wagmi as a rare gem and community based stronghold in the sea of
 capitalist refuse which currently swarms the chain/ I have got a friend to make a telegram 
 group for the token t.me/w_a_g_m_i 
I will join if wagmi reaches 1billion market cap and say "wagmi"/
lol_ thats pretty much it_ ill renounce ca and lock liq forever  due to the  turbulence of 
the year thus far/ 
Wagmi is a 100% comunity token with no dev tax_ all tax will go to liq/ and with 1 billion supply
my dream is to see 1 wagmi = 1$ or more.

CryptoCurrency  Enthusiastes  stumbled upon this contract and spread the word. The message of the token holder touched so many of us that are affected by this plague :  we want a risk-Free project that aims at giving back to the commmunity buy simple Tokenomics laws. Thus to gather as community and make this possible as the next Shiba Inu marking last year's spirit where people made good profit and actually promoted the cryptocurrency systems as a secure and safe replacement for fiats.

## Tokenomics:

The Wagmi Tokenomics work this way ! from the contract you will notice 2 main things : 

| Function      | Description |
| -----------  | ----------- |
| Buy/Sell Tax          | 1% goes to LP|       |
| Buy Policy          | < 4% * MCAP            |

Basically , if we calculate the Bayesian mean of the trading volume at a given time The market cap will always return to a certain floor level:

<!-- >> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;MCAP_{n+1} = \sum_{\forall i}{Trade_{i}} * 1% + LP + MCAP_{n}" title="\Large =MCAP_{n+1} = \sum_{\forall i}{Trade_{i}} * 1% + LP + MCAP_{n}" />
 -->
<!--  ![\Large MCAP_{n+1} = \sum_{\forall i}{Trade_{i}} * 1% + LP + MCAP_{n}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;MCAP_{n+1} = \sum_{\forall i}{Trade_{i}} * 1% + LP + MCAP_{n})
 -->

wich means that the token sustains itself from deflation incremently : 

> **slow median moon and steady stacking Market Cap**


### What is the best way to achieve the WAGMI = 1$ ?


This the dilemma ! on one hand the contract creator aimed the Tokenomics to be very predictable in a sense and rewards everyone who holds at least half of 10^n (n=1, 2, 3...) a safe mooning  , and this is very doable for whatever the size of the buy only if the market cap reaches 1m (assuming that the trade follows Mixed Gaussian Normal Law), since the LP always increase by BUY/SELL TAXES

# Marketing 

This is a community driven Token , all the marketing efforts are made by holders to make this token this year's Shiba Inu ! and we all believe as a community that the state of the bsc mainnet right now is pretty much a jungle of scums and empty projects that doesn't hold to the standards of blockchain and cryptocurrency systems !
We keep pushing for shilling and spreading the word of this unknown's dev message until it reaches more and more believers ! Once the website is live we will push for listing in the crypto space ! 

# ROAD MAP
Please note that we are a small community right now and as long as all of us contribute and be creative we can make wagmi forever alive in the BSC mainnet
